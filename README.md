# 🧠 AI Fitness Trainer

An AI-powered full-body workout assistant that leverages **Computer Vision**, **MediaPipe**, and **Flask** to track your exercise postures in real-time. It also includes an interactive **AI FitBot** for personalized fitness advice and a **BMI calculator** to assess your health.

## 🧩 Key Features

- 🎯 **Real-time posture detection** using MediaPipe
- 🔁 **Repetition counting** with posture validation
- ⏱️ **Automatic timer** for time-based exercises (e.g., walking)
- 🤖 **AI FitBot** for personalized fitness and diet queries
- 🧮 **BMI Calculator** to assess body composition
- 🌐 Web-based UI powered by **Flask**

## 🧠 How It Works

### 📹 Real-Time Exercise Tracker (`main.py` / `main1.py`)
- Uses **MediaPipe Pose** to detect body landmarks from webcam feed.
- Calculates joint angles using OpenCV to verify posture.
- Repetition logic handled based on specific body part movement.
- Supports sequential flow of exercises or single-mode (push-ups, walk, etc.)

> `main.py` – full body with timers  
> `main1.py` – single exercise routine

---

### 🧮 BMI Calculator (in `bmi.html`)
- Accepts **height and weight** from user.
- Calculates **Body Mass Index** and classifies health level:
  - Underweight
  - Normal
  - Overweight
  - Obese

---

### 🤖 AI FitBot (`fit.html`)
- Users can ask fitness-related queries (e.g., "Suggest a diet for muscle gain").
- Powered by **puter.ai API** for AI chat experience.
- Embedded in an elegant, mobile-responsive UI.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenCV**
- **MediaPipe**
- **Flask**
- **HTML/CSS/JS**
- **Puter.ai API (Chatbot)**
